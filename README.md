# Dasvyvisor

Everyone are talking about rust, and I've decided to know why. I've heard that rust is "safer", "cleaner" and "modern" so I want to figure out what all this buzz is about.

My plan is to use rust in order to develop a Hypervisor that would load as a Linux driver - at first with no special purpose.

## Goals

1. Skim over the rust book
2. Write an ELF loader
3. Write a kernel module to load the hypervisor
4. Write the hypervisor itself

I will be documenting my progress in my blog and I assume the project will take me a few weeks / months since I will be doing it at a very slow-pace.
